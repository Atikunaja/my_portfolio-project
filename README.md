I made this portfolio project on E-Commerce website using HTMl CSS PHP JAVASCRIPT
This project is concern with ordering and shopping varietiy of snacks online

INSPIRATION
Snacks Business is a profitable business in Nigeria that doesnâ€™t need huge amount of money for startup which laid too many competitors in the market. High rate of inflation In Nigeria made it hard for business owners to find customers, because there is too much competition in the market and limited customers.
	These reasons made me think of upgrading my business as well as expanding my customers through designing an e-commerce website that can help me reach many customers and advertise my products at ease.
