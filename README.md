I made this portfolio project on E-Commerce website using HTMl5 CSS PHP JAVASCRIPT MYSQL. This project is concern with ordering and shopping varietiy of snacks online

INSPIRATION
Snacks Business is a profitable business in Nigeria that doesnâ€™t need huge amount of money for startup which laid too many competitors in the market. High rate of inflation In Nigeria made it hard for business owners to find customers, because there is too much competition in the market and limited customers, regular customers buy on credits which cripple most entreneurs.
	These reasons made me think of upgrading my business as well as expanding my customers through designing an e-commerce website that can help me reach many customers and advertise my products at ease and eliminate buying goods on credit.
